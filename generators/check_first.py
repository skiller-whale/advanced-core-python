"""
The function `check_first` should receive a generator, and return its first
item, along with a generator that produces the original set of values.

* Run this script. You should see that `check_first` correctly returns the first
  item, but that the generator it returns no longer contains this item.

* Update this code so that the generator returned by check_first includes the
  exact same set of items as the input generator. You might need to write an
  additional function

  The output you see should be:

  The first square number is 1
  The first twelve square numbers are:
  1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144,
