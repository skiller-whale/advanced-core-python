"""
The function `fibonacci_numbers_list` below returns a list of the first `n`
Fibonacci numbers. This sequence starts with [1, 1] and then continues with
each new number being the sum of the previous two numbers:

So the third number is 1 + 1 = 2 => [1, 1, 2],
The fourth is 1 + 2 = 3 => [1, 1, 2, 3]
The fifth is 2 + 3 = 5 => [1, 1, 2, 3, 5] and so on.

You will implement the generator equivalent of this function,
`fibonacci_numbers_generator`, to do the same thing, but with a generator.

* Run this script, (`python3 <path>/generator_functions.py`) so you can see what the
  `test_fibonacci` function does, and make sure you understand the output.

* Uncomment the call to `test_fibonacci` at the bottom of this file, and update
  the `fibonacci_numbers_generator` function so that it generates the first
  `n` Fibonacci numbers.

* Run the script again, and notice the speed difference between the two
  functions (the sum of numbers produced should be the same).

* If you're feeling patient (this may take a while) try updating `COUNT` to
  `500_000` and run the script again.

WARNING: If you have less than 16GB of RAM free, this might use all of your
  available RAM and your computer might become unresponsive.

  On a modern machine, the generator function might take around 6s, whilst
  the list version could take well over a minute.
