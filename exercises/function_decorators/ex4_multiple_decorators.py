"""
The code in this script calls the same `ping` function as exercise 2, which
either returns a status code, or raises an error.

1. Run this script - you should see a repeated prompt, asking you to hit a key.
   This will repeat until a ping() call errors.

2. This script imports three decorators:
     * catch_errors - which you wrote in exercise 3
     * log_duration - which logs how long a function takes to run
     * debug        - which logs when a function is called, and what it returns

     Use these three decorators on the `get_log_level` and `check_connection`
     functions below, to give debugging information about how the program runs,
     and catch any errors that are thrown.

3. Run the script again, and take a look at the output. Does the order of the
   decorators matter?

4. Without editing any other files, use all three decorators to add
   functionality to the `ping` function before it gets called in
   `check_connection`.
