"""
The code below uses a list comprehension to generate all possible three letter
combinations in a list called `three_letter_combos_list`.

* Update the definition of `three_letter_combos_generator` to do the same thing
but with a generator expression.

* Run this script. The `tracemalloc` package is used to trace which lines of
code allocate memory, and how much is allocated. Compare the amount of memory
allocated for the list comprehension and the generator expression.

* The final output displays the first few results from the generator, and then
the number of items in the list comprehension and the generator expression. If
these numbers are different, why do you think that is?
