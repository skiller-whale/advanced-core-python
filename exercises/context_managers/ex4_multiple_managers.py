MULTIPLE CONTEXT MANAGERS

When testing, you often want to 'mock' some global properties.
For example, imagine that you want to ensure that a function always reports
the same time taken to execute.

1. Create a context manager that replaces the imported time function with
a function that always returns 0. When the context manager is exited
the global function should be restored to its previous value.

2. Use the `mock_time` context manager in `__main__` together with
    `Timing Manager` so that it prints a time of `0`.

3. Reverse the order of the context managers.
    Can you explain what is happening?

HINT: You can define a custom mock time function or you can use
    a lambda expression inside the `mock_time` context manager.
