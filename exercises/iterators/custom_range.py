"""INSTRUCTIONS
---------------

The built-in `range` function in Python isn't actually a function; it's an
iterable class that lets you iterate over integers. For example:

for i in range(3, 7)

will iterate over the values 3, 4, 5, 6, assigning each value to the variable i.

The `CustomRange` class below will replicate the behaviour of `range`, taking
in `start` and `end` values for a sequence of numbers.

It will also accept a `transform` argument. This should be a function that
takes in a value, and returns the next value in a sequence. If you wanted a
sequence that increased by 5 each time, `transform` would be: `lambda x: x + 5`

For example:

CustomRange(10, 30, transform=lambda x: x + 5) should generate the sequence 10, 15, 20, 25
CustomRange(2, 20, transform=lambda x: 2*x - 1) should generate the sequence 2, 3, 5, 9, 17


* Update the methods `__iter__` and `__next__` on `CustomRange` so that the
  iterations at the bottom of this file work correctly

* You will have to add a new attribute to CustomRange to keep track of the
  current iteration position, and update this in the `__iter__` and `__next__`
  methods.

* Run the code and make sure that the sequences printed look correct.
