"""
The code below uses a StatusMonitor class, which uses a separate thread to send
regular pings in the background when `run()` is called. It stops when its
`stop()` method is called.

1. Run this script. You should see that regular pings are being sent to three
   separate services. If you hit Enter the pings are meant to stop (the bottom
   three lines of this script), but they don't because
   `StatusMonitor.all_instances` does not yet work.

2. Write a class decorator called `register_instances`. This should modify a
   class so that:
       * It has a class attribute called `all_instances` that is a list
       * Each time a new instance is created, it is appended to `all_instances`

3. Use `register_instances` to decorate the `StatusMonitor` class. Run the
   script again, and check that when you hit Enter, the pings all stop.
